# Electromagnetic-comptability

This repo is for some labs in electromagnetic comptability I did during my exchange at Universit√© Laval in Canada. 
The main subjects discussed during the labs were : 

* capacitive coupling
* inductive coupling
* finite element method
* decoupling

The simulations corresponding to these subjects are available in this repo, as well as the lab reports containing the measurements
